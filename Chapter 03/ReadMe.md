Welcome to the **Fundamentals of Robotics** repository! This repository is dedicated to providing foundational knowledge and tools for robotics enthusiasts and professionals.

## Files Overview ðŸ“‚

### `DH.m`

The `DH.m` file focuses on the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, which are essential for describing the kinematic chains of robotic arms. The DH parameters are a standardized way to represent the relative transformations between links in a robot. This file contains:

- **Functionality:** Computes the transformation matrices based on the DH parameters.
- **Usage:** Useful for creating and analyzing the kinematic models of robotic manipulators.
- **Goal:** Facilitate the understanding and implementation of robotic kinematics by providing a straightforward approach to derive the transformation matrices.

### `Q2Rot.m`

The `Q2Rot.m` file is designed to handle quaternion to rotation matrix conversions. Quaternions are a robust way to represent orientations and rotations, avoiding the gimbal lock issue encountered with Euler angles. This file includes:

- **Functionality:** Converts a given quaternion into a corresponding rotation matrix.
- **Usage:** Essential for applications involving 3D rotations, such as in aerospace, robotics, and computer graphics.
- **Goal:** Provide a reliable method for transforming quaternions to rotation matrices, ensuring accurate and efficient handling of 3D rotational data.
