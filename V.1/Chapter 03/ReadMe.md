Welcome to the **Fundamentals of Robotics** repository! This repository contains essential code and documentation related to advanced representations in robotics, specifically from Chapter 3 of our study material.

## Files Overview ðŸ“‚

### `DH.m`

The `DH.m` file focuses on the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, essential for describing the kinematic chains of robotic arms. The DH parameters provide a standardized way to represent the relative transformations between links in a robot. This file includes:

- **Functionality:** Computes the transformation matrices based on the DH parameters.
- **Usage:** Fundamental for creating and analyzing the kinematic models of robotic manipulators.
- **Goal:** To simplify the understanding and implementation of robotic kinematics by offering a clear approach to derive transformation matrices.

### `Q2Rot.m`

The `Q2Rot.m` file handles quaternion to rotation matrix conversions. Quaternions are a robust method to represent orientations and rotations, avoiding the gimbal lock problem associated with Euler angles. This file contains:

- **Functionality:** Converts a given quaternion into a corresponding rotation matrix.
- **Usage:** Crucial for applications involving 3D rotations, such as in aerospace, robotics, and computer graphics.
- **Goal:** To provide a reliable method for transforming quaternions to rotation matrices, ensuring accurate and efficient handling of 3D rotational data.
