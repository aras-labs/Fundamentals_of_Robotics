## üöÄ How to Run a Simulation

To run a new simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Modify Simulation Parameters:**  
   Open the `Structural_Parameters` function and adjust the parameters according to your simulation requirements.

2. **Run the Main Simulation Script:**  
   Execute the `CL_Dynamic_Solver` script in the **Impedance Control** folder. This will launch the closed-loop simulation using the impedance control strategy.

3. **Analyze the Results:**  
   The `PlotData` function will automatically generate plots to visualize the simulation outcomes. Use these plots to assess the performance of the impedance control.
