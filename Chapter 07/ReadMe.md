## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

- **Singularity Analysis:**  
  Identifying singularities is critical in robotics to ensure smooth operation and avoid configurations where control may be compromised.

- **Redundancy Resolution:**  
  Optimal redundancy resolution is key for robots that possess more degrees of freedom than necessary for a given task. This chapter demonstrates strategies for both obstacle avoidance and singularity circumnavigation, ensuring safe and efficient robotic motion.

- **Practical Case Studies:**  
  The examples and case studies provided (7.1, 7.2, and 7.4) offer practical insights into the implementation of these advanced concepts in real-world scenarios.
