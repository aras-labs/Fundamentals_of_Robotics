## üìÇ Folder Overview

This chapter contains two main folders, each dedicated to a specific control strategy:

- **Compliance Control**  
  *Closed-loop simulation of compliance control on a 3R robot.*

- **Force Control**  
  *Closed-loop simulation of direct force control on a 3R robot.*

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Program Descriptions

Each folder includes the following MATLAB programs and functions:

1. **`CL_Dynamic_Solver`**  
   - *Main simulation code.*  
   This is the primary script that drives the closed-loop simulation.

2. **`CL_Dynamics`**  
   - *Core dynamic function.*  
   Implements the dynamic equations governing the 3R robot and is called by the main simulation code.

3. **`Dynamic_Matrices`**  
   - *Dynamic vector and matrices function.*  
   Computes the essential dynamic vectors and matrices for the 3R robot.

4. **`XXXX_Control`**  
   - *Controller function used in the closed-loop simulation.*  
   Replace `XXXX` with the specific controller name (e.g., `Compliance_Control` or `Force_Control`) for the simulation you are running.

5. **`PlotData`**  
   - *Results plotting function.*  
   Generates plots and visualizations to help analyze the simulation outcomes.

6. **`Collision`**  
   - *Collision detection and interaction wrench estimation function.*  
   Detects collisions and estimates the interaction wrench during the simulation.

7. **`IK`**  
   - *Inverse kinematics function.*  
   Calculates the inverse kinematics along with velocities and accelerations.

8. **`Kinematics`**  
   - *Forward kinematics and Jacobian matrices function.*  
   Computes the forward kinematics and the corresponding Jacobian matrices.

9. **`TP_quintic`**  
   - *Trajectory planner based on quintic polynomials.*  
   Designs smooth trajectories using quintic polynomial interpolation.

10. **`Structural_Parameters`**  
    - *Simulation parameter configuration function.*  
    Contains all simulation parameters in a structured format for easy configuration.

## üöÄ How to Run a Simulation

To run a new simulation:

1. **Modify Simulation Parameters:**  
   Open the `Structural_Parameters` function and adjust the parameters as needed for your simulation.

2. **Select the Appropriate Folder:**  
   Navigate to the folder corresponding to the control strategy you want to simulate:
   - For **Compliance Control**, go to the *Compliance Control* folder.
   - For **Force Control**, go to the *Force Control* folder.

3. **Execute the Main Simulation Script:**  
   Run the `CL_Dynamic_Solver` script in the selected folder to start the closed-loop simulation.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

- **Modular Controller Design:**  
  The controller functions are modular (e.g., `Compliance_Control` or `Force_Control`), allowing you to easily switch and test different strategies.

- **Comprehensive Simulation Framework:**  
  This framework integrates dynamic modeling, kinematics, collision detection, and trajectory planning, offering a complete environment for analyzing advanced control methods on a 3R robot.
